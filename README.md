This is a Kubernetes Mutating Admission Webhook (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/). 
It can apply arbitrary changes (a "patch") to a Pod's manifest. A patch can do anything from adding or changing metadata to containers and init-containers with volumes.

The Kubernetes API server only supports communication with webhooks over HTTPS - an init-container is included that automates cert generation 
and any necessary configuration (i.e. applying the `caBundle` to the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`).


## Problem Statement

It is a recurring requirement in Kubernetes deployments to transparently mutate Pod manifests - either to add new functionality transparently to existing deployments 
and applications, or to enforce compliance and other policies and requirements.

This webhook provides a flexible and scalable solution to those problems.


## Notable Options

### --patch

Path to the YAML file containing the patch to be applied to eligible Pods (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#pod-v1-core for help).

Patches support wildcards ("*") instead of specific names for containers, init-containers and volumes. 
If a wildcard is specified, the operation is applied to all existing containers/init-containers/volumes (see [examples](#Examples)). 

A patch can contain wildcard and regular operations simultaneously.

A patch can contain only one wildcard per type (container/init-container/volume) currently.

### --log-level

panic | fatal | error | warn | info | debug | trace


## Installation

### Helm

1. adjust the `values.yaml` in `deploy/helm` to your requirements
2. install the chart via `helm install k8s-pod-mutator deploy/helm -f deploy/helm/values.yaml`

By default, the webhook is reachable under "https://<service_name>:8443/mutate"

## Examples

Issue: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/18312

To apply the workaround proposed [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/18312#issuecomment-771116456)
simply install the Helm chart with the provided example values:

`helm upgrade --install k8s-pod-mutator deploy/helm -f values.yaml -f examples/values.example.yaml`.

This example adds an init-container
```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: wait-for-imds
      image: busybox:1.33
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'wget "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/" --header "Metadata: true" -S --spider -T 6']
```
to all Pods that have a Label `aadpodidbinding`.

Feature Request: https://github.com/bohlenc/k8s-pod-mutator-webhook/issues/3

Consider the following patch:
```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: ca
    image: alpine
    command: ["sh", "-c", "cp -r /etc/ssl/certs /volume"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /volume
      name: cacerts
  containers:
  - name: "*"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/ssl
      name: cacerts
  volumes:
  - name: cacerts
    emptyDir: {}
```
When this patch is applied, the `volumeMount` "cacerts" is added to all containers currently present in the pod.
